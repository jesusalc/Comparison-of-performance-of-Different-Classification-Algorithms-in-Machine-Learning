## Comparison of performance of Different Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning


### Tasks:

#### Step1:

Pick a dataset from Kaggle 
or other free sources that must be labelled. 
The choice of dataset is yours. It must contain enough entries to train your models.

Implement a python code to assess the performance of following classifiers on your dataset.

1. Decision Trees

2. Support Vector Classifier

3. Logistic Regression

4. KNN (from SCIKIT learn)

Indicate where you used this thing above with comments

#### Step 2:

Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python. 
This must be your own implementation and not the standard KNN from any of the python modules.

Explain the working of your code with proper labelling.

#### Step 3:

Test your implementation of KNN with the rest of the algorithms including.

The performance comparison must be based on the standard performance 
metrics of the classifiers i.e. ROC curve, and AUC.

You must highlight how you obtained the ROC curve and what does it imply.

The code should include implementation details for all these four
 classification algorithms.
